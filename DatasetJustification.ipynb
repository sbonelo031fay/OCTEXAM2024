    "## Dataset for Classification: Teacher Employment Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our classification task, the **Teacher Employment** dataset provides relevant features that align closely with our problem statement. Here are the key columns and their significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experience Level**: This column categorizes teachers based on their years of experience. Experience is often correlated with job performance, allowing us to classify employment success based on different experience levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Employment Type**: Understanding the type of employment (full-time, part-time, or contract) helps classify teachers based on job stability and performance. This feature is crucial for analyzing how different employment types impact overall job satisfaction and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary**: The total gross salary can be used to classify teachers into different pay brackets. This analysis helps identify trends in teacher compensation and understand the factors contributing to higher salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Ratio**: This column indicates the proportion of work done remotely, which can affect job satisfaction and performance. Classifying teachers based on remote work levels can provide insights into the best practices for teaching environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Company Size**: The average number of employees in the organization can impact available resources and support for teachers. Analyzing this column helps classify employment conditions and their effects on teacher retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these features, we can classify teachers based on various factors, yielding insights into hiring practices, salary structures, and retention strategies.\n",

    "## Dataset for Forecasting: Salary of Data Scientists\n",
    "\n",
    "For our forecasting task related to salary predictions, the **Salary of Data Scientists** dataset contains critical columns that align with our objectives. The following features are particularly relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Work Year**: This historical salary data is essential for identifying trends over time, enabling us to predict future salaries based on past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experience Level**: This variable is crucial for forecasting salary growth, as typically, an increase in experience correlates with higher salaries. Analyzing this relationship will aid in predicting salary levels for different experience categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Title**: The job title indicates the role and responsibilities associated with the position, which are often linked to salary expectations. This feature will help us create forecasting models specific to various job titles within the data science field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary Currency**: Understanding the currency of salaries paid allows for international comparisons and standardization of salary data across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary in USD (salarioinusd)**: This standardized column is vital for ensuring consistent analysis, allowing us to predict salary trends without the complications of currency fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Company Location**: The geographical aspect can significantly influence salary due to variations in cost of living. Including this feature in our forecasting models will provide a more nuanced prediction based on regional salary trends.\n",
